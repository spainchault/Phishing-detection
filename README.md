# Phishing Email Classifier

This project is a phishing email classifier built using Python and Streamlit. The classifier uses a Naive Bayes model to identify phishing emails based on the presence of certain spam words. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails and uses TF-IDF vectorization for text processing.

## Features

- **Spam Word Detection**: Identifies if an email contains spam words from a predefined list.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a Naive Bayes classifier for predicting phishing emails.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive user experience.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spainchault/phishingdetection.git
   cd phishingdetection
   python -m venv venv

# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download or place the dataset and spam word list:

Place your dataset file (Nazario_5.csv) in the project directory.
Ensure you have a spam_wordlist.txt file with one spam word per line.
Usage


Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download or place the dataset and spam word list:

Place your dataset file (Nazario_5.csv) in the project directory.
Ensure you have a spam_wordlist.txt file with one spam word per line.
Usage
To start the Streamlit app, run:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will open a new tab in your default web browser with the Phishing Email Classifier app.

Files
app.py: The main script for running the Streamlit app.
Nazario_5.csv: The dataset containing email bodies and labels (phishing or not).
spam_wordlist.txt: A text file containing spam words, one per line.
requirements.txt: List of Python packages required for the project.
Code Overview
contains_spam_words(email_body, spam_wordlist): Checks if an email body contains any spam words from the spam_wordlist.
__main__(): Main function to configure the Streamlit app, load data, train the model, and display results.
